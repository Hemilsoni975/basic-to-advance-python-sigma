INTERNET PROTOCOL SUITE :
APPLICATION LAYER - {HTTPS , WEBSOCKETS , SSL , IMAP , POP}
INTERNET LAYER - {IPV4 , IPV6} ADDRESSING PACKING
TRANSPORT LAYER - {TCP , UDP}

=> WHAT IS WEBSOCKETS?

-   A WEBSOCKETS IS LIKE A PHONE CALL, BUT ON INTERNET. THEY ALLOW COMPUTERS TO HAVE CONTINUOUS AND FAST CONNECTION
    WITH A SERVER. IT PERFORMS BIDIRECTIONAL COMMUNICATION.

-   IT WAS STANDARDIZED BY IETF(INTERNET ENGINEERING TASK FORCE) AS RFC-6455 IN DECEMBER 2011.

-   IETF DEFINES WEBSOCKETS PROTOCOL, A STANDARD FOR ESTABLISHING FULL-DUPLEX COMMUNICATION CHANNEL OVER SINGLE TCP
    (TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL) CONNECTIONS. HERE, FULL DUPLEX MEANS YOU SEND OR RECEIVE ANY DATA YOU WANT).

-   THE WEBSOCKETS PROTOCOL IS TITLED AS RFC "6455".HERE RFC SETS THE STANDARDS FOR HOW WEBSOCKETS CONNECTIONS SHOULD
    BE ESTABLISHED, MAINTAINED, AND USED.

-   WEBSOCKETS IS USED IN ALL TYPE OF APPLICATION LIKE CHAT APPS, LIVE STREAM VIDEO, OR MULTIPLAYER GAME.
    IT IS ALSO USED IN TRADING PLATFORM AND SOCIAL MEDIA APPLICATION.

-   WEBSOCKETS IS USED AS API OR LIBRARIES. IN PYTHON YOU CAN USE WEBSOCKETS USING PYTHON LIBRARIES LIKE `websockets`

-   A WEBSOCKETS IS DIFFERENT FROM HTTPS AS HTTPS ARE UNIDIRECTIONAL A SENDER HAS TO TRIGGER A RECORD AND HE WILL GET
    THE DATA WHILE WEBSOCKETS ARE BIDIRECTIONAL AS A SENDER CAN SEND THE DATA AND A RECEIVER ALSO CAN SEND THE DATA

==> EXAMPLES OF WEBSOCKETS :

-   CHATTING APP (WHATSAPP)
    ONLINE GAMES (LUDO)
    FINANCIAL TRADING (STOCK MARKET)
    LIVE SPORTS UPDATES (CRICBUZZ)
    INTERNET OF THINGS (SMART HOUSE), ETC.....
